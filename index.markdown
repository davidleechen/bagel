There is no way that I can fully describe in words the profoundness and effect that Bagel had on my life.

I knew that he would be a part of my life from a very young age, decades before he was born. My grandmother's sister BJ had a female beagle named Annie, and I loved that dog in the way a little boy loves his own puppy. She wasn't mine, but the time I spent at the lake on those hot summer nights playing with that dog are memories that haven't yet faded, not even a little. They set the stage for my future love, and yearning for the ability to have and care for animals that lasted under the surface of everything else that makes life busy.

It was Jeannie's idea to contact the breeder, to ask about beagles as a gift for my birthday. I didn't know it then, but this would trigger one of the most life altering things to happen to me, to us. They say having kids changes you, and he was my first furry child. It sure as hell wasn't like having a baby, but it was a step in that direction. Raising Bagel up from a pup to a toddlerpup to a teenpup to an adultpup to a grandpup felt like one of those moments where people's lives flash before their eyes. Eleven years flashed by in an instant and just like that I saw what other people have seen, a life flash before my eyes. Looking back on this experience, it isn't something you notice while you're in any of those infinite, specific moments. Herein lies one of the most important lessons Bagel ever taught me, which is that time is finite and you're a fool for wasting it. His passing made me reflect on my own time left with my family and caused me to reassess and reprioritize how I value said time.
